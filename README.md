# CyberInfoSecDevOps

This repo is named to reflect the absurd amount of information Cybersecurity professionals are expected to know.  
Basically, to deal with the existential dread of never knowing it all, constant imposter syndrome and general ADHD....I wanted to do an exercise in documenting my self improvement. 

This is my constructive outlet to get guud and upskill. Projects, certifications, deepdives, nothing is off limits in this here part of town.
